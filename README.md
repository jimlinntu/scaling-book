# How To Scale Your Model

This book aims to demystify the art of scaling LLMs on TPUs. We try to explain how TPUs work, how LLMs actually run at scale, and how to pick parallelism schemes during training and inference that avoid communication bottlenecks. The book is available at https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book.

### Acknowledgments

This book was written by Jacob Austin, Sholto Douglas, Roy Frostig, Anselm Levskaya, Charlie Chen, Sharad Vikram, Federico Lebron, Peter Choy, Vinay Ramasesh and Albert Webson at Google DeepMind. Many of the ideas were first derived by James Bradbury and Reiner Pope.

The website uses a Distill-style Jekyll theme created by https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio and the Distill team. Thank you!
